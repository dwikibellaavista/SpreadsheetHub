# Money Buddy App v2

Desc:
This project is designed to help you automatically budget your income and track your daily expenses. It allows you to record your spending from multiple banks and digital wallets, as well as from multiple users, making it easier to monitor your finances on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. The system automatically divides your spending into categories like Living Costs, Lifestyle, Short-term Savings, Investments, Zakat, Self-Development, and Others. The project also provides an overview and visualizations, so you can quickly see your total spending, compare categories, and gain insights into your financial habits.

Notes:
- Upload this project to Google Sheets to enjoy a clean and interactive layout.
- To operate the “Process” button on the Transaction sheet, simply fill in the input fields (K5–K15) and click the button. The associated script will automatically distribute the entered amounts into the appropriate categories and log them in the sheet, so all transactions are recorded neatly without needing manual input for each category.
- You can adjust the percentages for each category according to your needs.
